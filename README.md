# tempController
Arduino-based temperature controller with menu system

This uses a number of libraries, primarily for temperature sensors, the menu interface, and the PID algorithm. The hardware had two different versions, and HWv1 was my personal device so that's the one where I developed the code. It uses a modified PID library, which I have in my Github account.
